# launcher global `0x4d2c58`

## High-confidence identity

`0x4d2c58` is **not** the storage for a wrapper object.
It is a **runtime interface pointer slot** populated through launcher-side registration.

The strongest static identifier currently attached to this slot is:

- string argument: `"ILTLoginMediator.Default"` at `0x4ab34c`

So the current canonical name is:

- **`ILTLoginMediator.Default` runtime interface pointer**

## Source of truth

### Dynamic initializer
- `launcher.exe:0x494ab0`

```asm
push 0x1
push 0x4d2c58
push 0x4ab34c      ; "ILTLoginMediator.Default"
mov  ecx, 0x4d3218
call 0x4030d0
```

### Constructor path
- `0x4030d0`
- base ctor `0x4143c0`
- registration helper `0x414030`

## What the constructor proves

Inside `0x4030d0`:

- `[this+4]  = 0x4ab34c` → interface name string
- `[this+8]  = 1`
- `[this+0xc] = 0x4d2c58` → output slot address
- `*(uint32_t*)0x4d2c58 = 0` → zero the runtime pointer slot before registration
- then `0x414030(this)` registers the wrapper with launcher-global registry state rooted at `0x4d3d54`

So:

- object at `0x4d3218` = wrapper / binder / registrar
- global at `0x4d2c58` = resolved runtime interface pointer used later by startup

## Why this matters

When startup later does:

```asm
mov ecx, [0x4d2c58]
mov edx, [ecx]
call [edx+...]
```

it is using the **resolved interface pointer value**, not a wrapper object.

That means our reimplementation should not model `0x4d2c58` as a plain homemade struct.
It needs the original launcher-side acquisition / registration behavior.

## Verified uses in the original startup path

### Nopatch branch configures it
At `0x409a73` and `0x409a98` the launcher:

- parses `"0.1"` via `0x417440`
- loads `ecx = [0x4d2c58]`
- calls vtable methods at offsets:
  - `+0x1c`
  - `+0x24`

So the nopatch path actively configures the interface before client startup.

### Startup hands `0x4d6304` into it
At `0x40a3e9..0x40a3fe`:

```asm
mov ecx, [0x4d2c58]
mov [0x4d6304], eax
mov edx, [ecx]
push eax            ; eax = object just built for 0x4d6304
call [edx+0x08]
```

So one of the interface methods consumes the newly built launcher object from `0x4d6304`.

### Client startup receives it as InitClientDLL arg6
At `0x40a587`:

```asm
mov eax, [0x4d2c58]
push eax            ; arg6 to InitClientDLL
```

### Teardown also uses it
At `0x40b360..0x40b409` the launcher uses the same interface during cleanup, including vtable offsets:

- `+0x164`
- `+0x16c`
- `+0x0c`

## High-confidence conclusions

1. `0x4d2c58` is a **runtime interface pointer slot**.
2. Its registration string is **`ILTLoginMediator.Default`**.
3. The original nopatch path configures this interface before `InitClientDLL`.
4. The launcher passes the resolved pointer value to `InitClientDLL`.
5. A replacement launcher that skips this acquisition/registration path is not equivalent to the original.

## Current implication for reimplementation

The current custom launcher should stop treating arg6 as a vague `master database` or arbitrary placeholder.
It is much more likely a launcher-resolved `ILTLoginMediator.Default`-style interface pointer that must already be live by the time `InitClientDLL` is called.
